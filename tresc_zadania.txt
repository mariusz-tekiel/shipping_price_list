Create an app for shipping price calculation. The application should save every calculated shipping price in a database.

Specification:
•	The calculation form should contain fields:
o	postcode, 
o	total order amount, 
o	checkbox "long product".
•	Postcode is a 5-digit number. A user mustn't enter an incorrect value.
•	The shipping cost is based on zone, total order amount, and long product flag.
•	Zone means the first two digits of the postcode (examples: “35463” -> zone “35”, “23456” -> zone “23”).
•	Zones are grouped by shipping price (more than one zone has the same shipping cost).
•	User can import zones from a CSV file; sample data are in zones.csv.
•	There is a shipping pricelist page.
•	If the total order amount is greater than 12500 € then we should add a 5% discount to the total shipping price.
•	If we have a long product, we should add extra shipping cost - 1995€.
